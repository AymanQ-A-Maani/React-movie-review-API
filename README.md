# General info

***`This React API project is work in progress`***, it's a React movie review website. At the moment, it features an API from [themoviedb website](https://www.themoviedb.org/), registration, and login form with validation using "joi" library. I will soon add Pagination.
# Project's aim

This project is a part of an online full-stack Bootcamp. I was tasked to build a single-page React movie review App using `React hooks`. It features local storage, and various libraries like Axios, Joi, React Router and Bootstrap CSS framework.   

# What can you do on this website?

### 1. Use the links in the navbar to navigate to different parts of the website once you log in. At the moment, *`only Movies tab works, and I'm working on making all tabs available.`*
### 2. Register using the registration form. *`Multiple users can register.`*
### 3. Use the login form to log in with the user credentials you registered and reveal the links in the navbar.
### 4. In the movies tab, you can access each movie's details by clicking on the movie poster.
